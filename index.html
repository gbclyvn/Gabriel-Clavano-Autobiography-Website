                <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                <p>I'm Gabriel, a pretty chill guy who loves hanging out with people. I'm the kind of person who spends a lot of time on my phone and computer, but I'm okay with that. I'm conscious about my body because I used to be really overweight, so fitness is something I care about now. I get curious about coding because you can do so much with computers and online stuff. But honestly, I'm more about enjoying life and hanging out with friends than being a tryhard. I'm outgoing, I love talking to people, and I really regret not socializing more before. Now I just want to enjoy being a teenager while I still can. I'm respectful to everyone, and I'm scared of hurting or offending people. I'm pretty laid-back about things.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="intro-card">
                <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
                <p>I want to build cool stuff with code that actually helps people. Not for money or to be famous, but because I believe tech can solve real problems and make life better. I'm curious about what technology can do because there's so much you can create online and on computers. The power of technology just makes me want to learn more. I learned that hard work and doing the same thing over and over is way better than just being smart. I learned this from all my mistakes and failures. But honestly, what drives me most right now is just living and enjoying the moment. I don't want to waste my teenage years. I want to have fun, make memories, and be with people I care about.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="intro-card">
                <h3>My Responsibility</h3>
                <p>I'm the oldest of four brothers, so people expect me to do good things and show them the right way. There's a lot of pressure to be the example, and honestly, that pressure changed who I am. I'm still trying to figure out what I want in life, but I want to turn all my bad times into something better. My brothers are watching everything I do, and I take that seriously. I want to be someone they can look up to and learn from. I'm scared of letting them down or making wrong choices that they might copy. That responsibility pushes me every day to be better, to make smarter decisions, and to show them that even when things are hard, you can keep fighting. It's not easy, but it's something I have to do.</p>

            <h2>Early Life & Roots 🌱</h2>
            <p>I was born on November 25, 2006 in Santa Maria, Bulacan. It was a small, quiet place and I have good memories from when I was a kid there. But when I was 8 or 9, my family moved to Iligan City. Now I live in Green Village, Purok 2-A, Katipunan. It's home to me now, and I got used to living in the city.</p>
            <p>I went to Tambo Central School for elementary. That's where I made my first friends and started learning about myself. Then in high school, I went to Iligan City East National High School. Those years were really hard. I wasn't doing well in school, and things at home were bad too. I had a lot of problems, I wasn't focused, and sometimes I felt really lost and didn't know what to do.</p>
            <p>But being the oldest brother also saved me. I realized that my brothers were watching what I do. If I kept failing, they would think it's okay to fail too. So I had to stand up and fight my problems. Both the problems at school and at home. It wasn't easy, and I'm still fighting every day, but that's what made me the person I am now.</p>

                <h2>Education & Growth 🎓</h2>
            <p>I'm a first-year student at MSU-Iligan Institute of Technology, taking BS Computer Application (Internet of Things). It's a newer program, and honestly, I love it way more than high school. I feel like I actually belong here, learning stuff that makes sense to me.</p>
            <p>But things weren't perfect in high school. I struggled a lot. My grades weren't good, and my honors ranking was way down because of the problems at home and in school. I didn't really care much about studying back then because I was dealing with so much heavy stuff at home. There were really dark moments where I felt like I would never get better at anything.</p>
            <p>But then something changed when I was 17, 18. I realized that I was almost grown up, and nobody was gonna fix my life for me. I had to make a real choice. Either keep being stuck with my past, or fight for something better. I chose to fight. Now I show up to class, I study hard, and I really want to get Cum Laude. I want to learn real skills, I want to build things. No more giving up, no more being lazy. That's not me anymore.</p>

            <h2>The Pressure & Growth 💪</h2>
            <p>Being the oldest of four brothers meant a lot of people expected things from me. My parents wanted me to be the good example. Teachers wanted more from me than other students. Everyone around me wanted me to have everything figured out. It was a lot of pressure, and sometimes it felt like I couldn't breathe.</p>
            <p>In high school, all that pressure broke me down. My grades were low. I had problems with teachers and school. I was angry because I felt like I was being pulled in two different directions. I felt like I had to be perfect at school, but also deal with all the bad stuff at home. Home was a mess too, and it made me sad and angry all the time.</p>
            <p>But then I realized something. My three brothers are watching me and learning from what I do. Whatever happens to me, they'll probably go through the same thing. So I had to grow up and stop blaming other people. I had to be the kind of brother I wish I had. That hurt to realize, but it was important. Now I'm fighting every day to become someone my brothers can be proud of and look up to.</p>

            <h2>Goals & Dreams 🎯</h2>
            <p>My biggest dream is to become a Software Engineer and work from home. I want to work anywhere I want, like in coffee shops or different countries. I don't want to be stuck in one office working for someone else my whole life.</p>
            <p>I want to graduate with Cum Laude honors. Not because of the prestige, but because it proves I can do hard things. It proves my past doesn't define my future. It shows my family that I actually changed.</p>
            <p>Beyond that, I want financial independence so my family doesn't struggle like they did before. I want to help my brothers achieve their dreams. I want to travel the world, experience different cultures, meet interesting people. And maybe one day, build something like code, a product, or a company that actually helps people solve real problems.</p>

                    <h4>Thomas Edison</h4>
                    <p>Thomas Edison made the light bulb. He didn't just get it right the first time. He tried and failed 1,000 times before it worked. He said that success is 1% having a good idea and 99% doing the hard work. This means you have to work really hard and keep trying even when you fail a lot.</p>
                    <p><strong>What I Learned:</strong> Every time I fail a project, every time someone says no to me, every bug in my code is not bad. It's just information that helps me learn. It's the hard work, the late nights coding, the doing the same thing over and over, the discipline of showing up every single day that makes dreams come true. There are no shortcuts to anything worth having.</p>
